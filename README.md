# Kotlin Slides

Those are the slides for the kotlin introduction at the defdev android security "thing". See: [https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-Vienna/events/251209190/](https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-Vienna/events/251209190/)

# Outline

## Kotlin itself

### Yet another

* Hybride (Object oriented and functional) statically typed JVM language
* Less is more: get inspired by others and only take the best
* Fully interop with Java
* Lombok anyone?

### JetBrains

* Backed by a company, built for the industry
* Still open source compiler and tools
* Well known for their IDEs (IntelliJ, AndroidStudio) => superb tooling support

## Kotlin + Security

### Null reference safety

* Less bugs/crashes (might reveal sensitive data)

### More concise

* Less code to maintain (less code)
* Easier to read

## Kotlin + Android

### Java on steroids

* Runs on Android (1.6 bytecode)

### Google supported

* Official supported language (besides java the only one)

## Outlook

* Generate JavaScript and Native code
* Feature list:
	* Type inference, smart casts, properties, named & default arguments, data classes, sealed classes, reified generics, delegates, string interpolation, pattern matching, operator overloading, conditions as expressions, == as equals, range expressions, rename imports, backticks for escaping, improved collection API
